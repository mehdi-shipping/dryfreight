# DryFreight — Session Log

## Session 1 — Feb 2026
### Done
- Built voyage cost calculator (single HTML file, self-contained)
- 235 ports embedded, haversine routing, auto vessel selection
- TC hire + bunkers + port DAs + canal tolls + war risk
- Set up GitHub repo: github.com/mehdi-shipping/dryfreight
- Set up Vercel live hosting: dryfreight.vercel.app/

### Calculator known issues / next
- (to be filled from user feedback this session)

### Strategic decisions made
- Start with dry bulk only, expand to tankers/gas later
- Crowd-sourced fixture data via WhatsApp as core mechanic
- Positioning: first open transaction-based freight index
- No external JSON dependencies — everything self-contained in one HTML file
